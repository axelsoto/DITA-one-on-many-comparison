Work flow fields 
  Understand the fields used when creating work flows. 
   
   
	  
		The following tables describe the
		  fields used when creating work flows. 
		 
		 
		 
		Work flow basic details 
		 
			  
				 
				  Field 
				   
				 
				 
				  Description 
				   
				 
			  
		   
			  
				 
				  Name

				  Description 
				   
				 
				 
				  Describe the purpose of the

				  Product applicability 
				   
				 
				 
				  Select the product for which
					 the work flow can be used. 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Parent work flow 
				   
				 
				 
				  A parent work flow is one
					 that can be used at the beginning of a work flow. If it is not a parent, then
					 it is a child that can be selected during a work flow already in progression. 
				   
				 
			  
		   
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		Work flow state details

					 assigned to this state. 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Options 
				   
				 
				 
				  Standard flow 
				   
				 
				 
				  Standard work flows progress

					 this type of work flow: 
				   
					  
						Can complete
							 work flow gives the person in this state of the work flow the
						  option to end the work flow entirely, instead of progressing to the next state.

							 approval indicates that the person in this state of the work flow
						  to indicate their approval before the work package can proceed to the next
