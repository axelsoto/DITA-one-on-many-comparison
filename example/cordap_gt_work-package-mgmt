Work packages 
  Work packages are the keys to the end product. 
   
   
	  
		After the initial
		  set-up in CORDAP is complete and you are ready assign work, the next step is to
		  create and assign work packages for the release. 
		 
		 A work package is
		  simply a work assignment. The Work Packages tab is where you create, assign,
		  and manage the work assignments for the release. The initial view of the tab
		  shows all work packages, their states, and other basic information. Work
		  packages that are approaching due or late are flagged for easy viewing.

		Work packages can be linked to a
		  feature, a change request, or an asset. If a work package is linked to an item,
		  then the work package appears in the details for that item. 
		 
		After a work package is assigned to
		  a resource, an auto-generated email notification is sent to the assignee with
		  all the details for the assignment.
