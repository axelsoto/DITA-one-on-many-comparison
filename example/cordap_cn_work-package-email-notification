Work package assignment notification 
  The work package assignment notification email is often your first
	 point of contact with CORDAP. 
   
   
	  
		 Every time a work package is
		  assigned to you, CORDAP sends you an auto-generated email. This email provides
		  you with the key details for the work package, such as the step for which you
		  are responsible, as well as several quick links. 
		 
		 
		   
			 Add 
				cordap@innovatia.net to your Safe Senders
				list in your email program to ensure that email from CORDAP is delivered
				instead of being identified as suspicious or junk email. 
			  
		   
		 
		Be sure to carefully review the
		  email. If you have any questions about the assignment, contact the person who
		  assigned the work package to you.
