242-We were on tarmac taxiing out. There apparently was a delay in takeoff due to unknown reasons and this was not communicated by the cockpit to the flight attendant's. Because of the delay, safety check were completed another time to ensure customers were in compliance before takeoff. While safety checks were being completed the pilots had initiated takeoff without making the announcement flight attendants prepare for takeoff. One flight attendant was not close to their assigned jumpseat and had to take closest available jumpseat for safety. us si us so si.
