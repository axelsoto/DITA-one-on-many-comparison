<p>CORDAP</p><p>Work assignments in one place for all to view and trackâ€”managers,
	 assignees, reviewers, and anyone else on the project.

		<p> Innovatia has developed a content
		  reuse, development, and planning application known as CORDAP. 
		</p> 
		<p>CORDAP uses the terms 
		  product and 
		  release to identify the hierarchal relationship and construction
		  of the content. A product is a project or a portfolio that can contain one or
		  more content releases. Each release comprises features or change drivers that
		  impact the content in the final deliverables. The topics impacted by the
		  features and change drivers are grouped into work packages and assigned to
		  authors for the content development. After all work packages progress through
		  the work flow, the deliverables are complete for that release.
