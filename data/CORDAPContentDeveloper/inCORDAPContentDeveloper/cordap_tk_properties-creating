		<p>Create properties so that they can
		  be applied to work packages or assets. 
		</p>
		<p>Properties identify key information
		  about a work package or an asset that has been added to CORDAP. For instance,
		  if you create a Name property for content units, you can designate that
		  property to be used as its name in CORDAP. So if a user adds a name for a topic
		  or map, using the Properties tab for the asset, then CORDAP uses that name
		  instead of the filename when referring to the asset. 
		</p> 
		 
		<p> 
		   
			 <p>Properties created in CORDAP and
				applied to content units are not carried over into the CMS. When you set a
				property for a topic or bookmap, there is no change to the actual file in the
				CMS. The property is set in CORDAP only.

		<p>Property created for a work package</p>
		<p>You might want to add a property to indicate the priority level for
		  work packages. You can create a 
		  Priority property, set the Data type as 
		  Number, apply it to 
		  Work Packages, click 
		  Select from a list of values, and then enter the
		  values that you want included as options for property. Then when work packages
		  are created, the 
		  Priority can be set in the work packages's
		  Properties tab. Using this information, the content developers know which work
		  packages are the highest priority and can address them first.
