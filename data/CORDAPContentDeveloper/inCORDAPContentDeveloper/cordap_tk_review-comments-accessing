			  Content from a CMS must be
				linked to the work package. 
			 
				
			  
		   
		   
			 Review comments are added to the
				output. 
			  
		   
		</ul> 
		<p>After a reviewer adds comments to
		  the HTML output, you can view those comments in the HTML output generated by
		  CORDAP. Authors are expected to review and acknowledge each review comment
		  using the 
		  Status options. 
		 
		</p><p> As a reviewer, you
		  might need to go back into the comments to see a comment's status or to make
		  changes to the comment.
