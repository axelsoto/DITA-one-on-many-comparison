			  Content from a CMS must be
				linked to the work package. 
			 
				
			  
		   
		   
			 Ensure the impacted topics are

		<p>When a work package transitions into
		  a review state, CORDAP generates generic HTML output for viewing and also
		  allows the capture of comments directly in the output. If you make changes to
		  the content and want to have the output regenerated without transitioning to
		  the next state, you can do so manually.
