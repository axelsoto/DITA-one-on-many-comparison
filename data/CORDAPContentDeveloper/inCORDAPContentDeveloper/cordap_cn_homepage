<p>Home page</p><p>The home page is your initial view into CORDAP. 
  </p> 
	 <p> 
		<p> The home page has three sections:
		  My Products, Recently Viewed, and a main window. Using these areas, you can see
		  information specific to the products on which you are assigned, work packages
		  assigned to you, and unassigned work packages that you can assign to yourself. 
		</p> 
	  
	 </p><p> 
		<p>My Products</p> 
		<p>In this section of the home page,
		  you can see all products on which you are assigned a role. By expanding the
		  product, you see each release for that product. Simply click the release name
		  to see the release-specific information for that product. 
		</p> 
	  
	 </p><p> 
		<p>Recently Viewed</p> 
		<p>This list is a shortcut to the 10
		  most recent releases you viewed. Instead of accessing your release through 
		  My Products, you can simply select the release
		  name in this view to take you directly to the release-specific information. 
		 
		</p><p>You can clear the list by clicking 
		  Clear this list. Clearing your browser cookies
		  also clears this list.

		<p>Main window</p> 
		<p>Based on your permissions, there are
		  different tabs within the main window: My Work, Dashboard, and Resource Usage. 
		</p> 
		<p>My Work
		  displays all work packages assigned to you. From here you can update your work
		  packages, view your work package history, lock source content, or assign an
		  unassigned work package to yourself. 
		 
		</p><p>The 
		  Dashboard displays status details for your
		  products and releases. It shows you status details for a release, iteration,
		  deliverables, and work packages. Work package time lines provide details on the
		  progression of work packages throughout the work flows and over a period of
		  time.
		 
		</p><p>The 
		  Resource Usage tab displays usage information
		  for the resources on your products. You can view the usage details of the
		  resources by product, resource, or role.
