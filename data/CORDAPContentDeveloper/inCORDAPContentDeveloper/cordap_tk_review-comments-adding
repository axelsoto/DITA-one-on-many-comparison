			  Content from a CMS must be
				linked to the work package. 
			 
				
			  
		   
		  Have your review email
			 notification accessible. 
		  </ul> 
		<p>After you integrate a CMS with
		  CORDAP, you can generate HTML output to use for review of the content. As a
		  reviewer, you can add your comments directly into the HTML output. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		   
			 <p>HTML output is generated using
				a generic HTML style sheet. The review output is very basic and is intended
				only for review of the content. The review comments should not address items
				such as appearance or style.

			 comment.

		<p> Your review comments are saved
