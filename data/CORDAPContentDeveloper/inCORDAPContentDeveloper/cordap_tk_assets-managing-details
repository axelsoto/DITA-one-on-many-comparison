		<p>Assets are the pieces of content
		  added to CORDAP for the release. Your team might be using properties to
		  identify key information about each asset, such as name, type, or SME. View
		  this information, as well as a plain-text view of the content using the Assets
		  tab. 
		</p> 
		<p>If you identify an asset as being a
		  specified deliverable type, then it is included on the Deliverables dashboard
		  when linked to a work package. 
		</p> 
		 
		   
			 <p>Properties created in CORDAP and
				applied to content units are not carried over into the CMS. When you set a
				property for a topic or bookmap, there is no change to the actual file in the
				CMS. The property is set in CORDAP only.
