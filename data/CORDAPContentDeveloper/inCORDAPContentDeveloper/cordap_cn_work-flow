		<p>Introduction</p> 
		<p>At the beginning of
		  a project, you must establish a work flow for the work assignments. You must
		  consider the entire authoring process from start to release, including users
		  involved, and whether or not you are linking Content Management System (CMS)
		  content with CORDAP. Take time to plan what your project needs and discuss with
		  the CORDAP System Administrator to make it happen. 
		</p> 
		<p>After a work flow
		  is established, it must be communicated with the CORDAP System Administrator,
		  so that it can be implemented into CORDAP. This can take several days of
		  tweaking, so it is important to plan this out well in advance of the project
		  start. 
		</p> 
		<p> At the
		  beginning of a project, a work flow is developed for the work assignments. In
		  CORDAP, each stage of the work flow is called a step. It is important that you
		  know and understand the work flow set out for your project, as well as your
		  role throughout that work flow.

		</p> 
		<p>At the beginning of a project, a work flow is
		  established for all work assignments. The work flow must take into
		  consideration the entire authoring process from start to release, including
		  users involved, and whether or not CORDAP connects with the Content Management
		  System (CMS). The work flow is established by the key members on the project
		  along with the CORDAP System Administrator. The key people might include the
		  project manager, information architect, and lead writer.
		</p>
		<p>After the work flows are established, it is the CORDAP
		  System Administrator who creates and applies the work flows to the product.

		<p>Types of work flows</p> 
		<p>It is important to understand the
		  difference between a standard work flow and a child work flow. A standard work
		  flow progresses from one state to the next with only one assignee per state,
		  for example: 
		  AuthoringEditingRevisionsComplete.
		  
		 
		</p><p>A child work flow splits a parent
		  work flow into multiple concurrent states. For example, creating a child work
		  flow for Peer review allows the parent work flow to split, involving multiple
		  reviewers reviewing the content at the same time. The state of the parent work
		  flow does not transition to the next state until all required Peer reviewers
		  complete the review. For example: 
		  AuthoringEditingRevisionsPeer
				review x 3Revisions from
				PeersComplete. 
		 
	 </p> 
	 </p><p> 
		<p>Multiple work flows</p> 
		<p>CORDAP does allow for multiple work
		  flows on one project. For instance, there can be one work flow for work
		  packages (small groups of individual topics) and another work flow for final
		  deliverables. 
		</p> 
		<p>A simple work
		  flow might include: 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		<ul> 
		   
			 Authoring 
			  
		   
		   
			 Editing 
			  
		   
		   
			 Implementing editing comments 
			  
		   
		   
			 Client review 
			  
		   
		   
			 Implementing client review
				comments 
			  
		   
		   
			 Final client review 
			  
		   
		   
			 Release 
			  
		   
		 
		</ul> 
		</p><p>Multiple work flows might include: 
		</p><p> 
		<ul> 
		   
			 Topic development work flow: 
			  
				 
				  Authoring 
				   
				 
				 
				  Editing 
				   
				 
				 
				  Implementing editing changes
					 
				   
				 
				 
				  Peer review 
				   
				 
				 
				  Implementing peer review
					 changes 
				   
				 
				 
				  Complete 
				   
				 
			  
			  
		   
		   
			 Deliverable review work flow: 
			  
				 
				  Preparing deliverable for
					 client review 
				   
				 
				 
				  Client review 
				   
				 
				 
				  Implementing client review
					 comments 
				   
				 
				 
				  Release 
				   
				 
			  
			  
		   
		 
		</ul> 
	 </p></p><p> 
		<p>Approvals</p> 
		<p>There are three options available
		  when approving content in a work package: Approved, Approved with changes, and
		  Changes Requested. If a reviewer uses Changes requested, then after the author
		  makes the changes the work package should go back to the reviewer for final
		  approval. 
		</p> 
	  
	 </p><p> 
		<p>Work flow example</p> 
		<p>The following is an example of a
		  content development work flow with a child work flow to implement multiple peer
		  reviews. Peer reviews #1, #2, and #3 are Peer review states generated from the
		  child work flow, and all other states are generated from the parent work flow.
