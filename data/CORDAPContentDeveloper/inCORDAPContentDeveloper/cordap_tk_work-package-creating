<p>Creating work packages</p><p>Work packages are the work assignments for the release. 
  </p> 
	  
		<ul> 
		   
			  If you are linking CMS content
				to the work package, it must already be added as an asset. 
			  
		   
		 
	 </ul> 
	  
		<p> For the release, create as many
		  work packages as you require to get the work done. For every assignment, be
		  sure to create a work package, so that you can monitor it and ensure it is
		  completed.
