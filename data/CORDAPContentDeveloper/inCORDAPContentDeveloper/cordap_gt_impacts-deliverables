<p>Know your impacts and deliverables</p><p>For your release, know what is changing the product and what
	 deliverables are impacted by the changes. 
  </p> 
	 <p> When you begin planning a release,
		you probably ask yourself several questions: 
	 </p> 
	 <p> 
	 <ul> 
		 
		  What are the new features for this
			 release? 
		   
		 
		 
		  Which topics are being changed? 
		   
		 
		 
		   Which deliverables are being
			 changed? 
		   
		 
		 
		  Are the changes being made all at
			 once or over several different time periods? 
		   
		 
	  
	 </ul> 
	 </p><p>As you begin to
		answer these questions, you can start adding the features, assets,
		deliverables, and iterations to CORDAP to begin the content development process
		for the release. 
	 </p><p>Ultimately, you are
		going to create work packages to assign to your team members. When you create
		the work packages, you can link them back to the items you added here. 
	 </p><p>During planning, the
		person responsible for maintaining CORDAP adds information for the features,
		assets, deliverables, iterations, and change drivers. This information is
		available to you throughout the duration of the project. It is quite often
		linked to the work packages assigned to you, making it easy to find the
		information you need during your piece of the content development.

		<p>Features</p> 
		<p>Typically, a release is driven by
		  features added to a product. These features are most often changes to the
		  product, either enhancements or new functionality. There is usually source
		  documentation for the feature explaining the details of the feature. In the
		  Features tab, you can keep track of each feature and make notes as to where the
		  source documentation is stored, so that all members of the team can easily find
		  the information they need. The Features tab also displays all work packages and
		  change requests related to the feature. 
		</p> 
	  
	 </p><p> 
		<p>Assets</p> 
		<p>Assets are considered to be the
		  content source files (topics or maps) for the product. Use of the Assets tab
		  requires a CMS connection. By including assets in CORDAP, work packages can be
		  linked to the files it impacts. This allows the content developer to lock the
		  source files from within CORDAP. It also enables CORDAP to generate HTML output
		  of the content for reviewers. 
		</p> 
		<p>A deliverable is the item that is
		  delivered to the client once all the work is completed. It might be a document,
		  a help set, or a training course. By adding deliverable maps as assets and
		  identifying them as deliverables, they can link to the work packages that
		  impact them. Throughout the release, the work package list can be filtered by
		  deliverable. This shows the status of each work package linked to the
		  deliverable, so you can see if all the work is completed or what is still in
		  progress for the selected deliverable. 
		</p> 
		
		<p>The Deliverables dashboard is
		  populated when an asset, identified as a deliverable, is linked to a work
		  package. The dashboard provides you with a high level view of the progress
		  being made for the release. You can drill down from the release-level to view
		  progress by deliverable, and then by iteration for the deliverable. 
		</p></p><p> 
		<p>Iterations</p> 
		<p>Iterations are used to divide a
		  release into different time frames. Perhaps you have two features due by the
		  end of one month and three features due by the end of the next month. By adding
		  iterations, you can place the required work packages into the appropriate
		  iteration. The iterations appear with a few key items displayed, including a
		  general progress state for the iteration. This provides an easy view to help
		  ensure target dates are met. 
		</p> 
	  
	 </p><p> 
		<p>Change drivers</p> 
		<p>Change drivers can also impact your
		  release for content development. Change drivers can include bug fixes, feature
		  modifications, or any other adjustments that might not be considered a full
		  feature. Using the Change Drivers tab, they can be added to CORDAP and then
		  linked to work packages.
