<p>Work package assignment notification</p><p>The work package assignment notification email is often your first
	 point of contact with CORDAP. 
  </p> 
	 <p> 
		<p> Every time a work package is
		  assigned to you, CORDAP sends you an auto-generated email. This email provides
		  you with the key details for the work package, such as the step for which you
		  are responsible, as well as several quick links.

			 <p>Add 
				cordap@innovatia.net to your Safe Senders
				list in your email program to ensure that email from CORDAP is delivered
				instead of being identified as suspicious or junk email. 
			  
		  </p> 
		</p><p>Be sure to carefully review the
		  email. If you have any questions about the assignment, contact the person who
		  assigned the work package to you.
