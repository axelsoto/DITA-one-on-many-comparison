				  Resource 
				   
				 
				 
				  This shows how much of the
					 work from every release is assigned to the resource. 
				   
				  Calculated using the Release
					 Hours information from every release on which the resource is used. 
				   
				  For instance: 
				   
					  
						Release 1: 100 of 500
						  hours (20%) 
						 
					  
					  
						Release 2: 300 of 500
						  hours (60%) 
						 
					  
				   
				   
				 
				 
				  40% 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Release Hours 
				   
				 
				 
				  This shows how much of the
					 release work is assigned to the resource. 
				   
				  Calculated using the number
					 of assigned hours for a resource compared to the number of planned hours for
					 all work packages in the release. 
				   
				 
				 
				  100 of 500 (20%) 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Progress 
				   
				 
				 
				  This shows the total
					 progress of a resource on their work package assignments. 
				   
				  Calculated using the number
					 of actual hours compared to the sum of actual and remaining hours for all
					 assigned work. 
				   
				 
				 
				  75 of 100 (75%) 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Work Remaining 
				   
				 
				 
				  Number of assigned work
					 hours left to complete. 
				   
				  Calculated using the number
					 of remaining hours on assigned work packages. 
				   
				 
				 
				  25 
				   
				 
			  
			  
				 
				  Allocation 
				   
				 
				 
				  Indicates how much of a
					 resource's time must be used to meet the assignment due dates for the
					 identified product and release. 
				   
				  Calculated using the number
					 of remaining hours on a work package, the number of working hours until it is
					 due, and doing this for every assignment. 
				   
				  Indicates how much of a
					 resource's time must be used to meet their assignment due dates for all
					 assignments regardless of product or release.
