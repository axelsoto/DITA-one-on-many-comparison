			 The work package must be
				created. 
			  
		   
		   
			 Assignee must already exist as a

	 </ul> 
	  
		<p>When you start a work package, you
		  can assign it to a specific resource, or opt to leave the resource field empty.
		  When you assign a work package to a resource, an auto-generated email
		  notification is sent to the assignee with the details you added for the work
		  package. If you leave the resource field empty, the work package appears as an
		  unassigned work package that a resource can self-assign from the My Work tab.
